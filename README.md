### About the Experiment 

The hydraulic machines, which convert the mechanical energy into hydraulic energy, are called pumps. The hydraulic energy is in the form of pressure energy. If the mechanical energy is converted in to pressure energy bymeans of centrifugal force acting on the fluid, the hydraulic machine is called centrifugal pump.

The centrifugal pump acts as a reversed of n inward radial flow reaction turbine. This means that the flow in centrifugal pumps is in the radial outward directions. The centrifugal pumps works on the principal of forced vertex flow, which means that an external torque rotates a certain mass of liquid, the rise in pressure head of the rotating liquid, the rise in pressure head of the rotating liquid takes place. The rise in pressure head at any point of the rotating liquid is proportional to the square of tangential velocity of (i.e. rise in pressure head-VÂ²/2g or 'r/2g) the liquid at

that point. Thus at the outlet of the impeller where radius is more, the rise in pressure head will be more and the liquid will be lifted to a high level.

Centrifugal pump is a mechanical device, which consists of a body, impeller and a rotating mean e. Motor, Engine etc. impeller rolates in a stationary body and sucks the fluid through its axes and delivers through its periphery. Impeller has an inlet angle, outlet angle and peripheral speed, which affect the head and discharge. Impeller is rotated by motor or i.c engine or any other device.
